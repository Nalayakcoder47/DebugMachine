# DebugMachine
A Inline Machine that helps when debugging in C++

## Using
## Including
Simply include the file "debugMachine.h" into all of the C++ files you want to use it's features in. It will by standard create an object of the name "d" - I't will be used to debug.

## Setting up
At first, the attribute `writing` of d has to be set to true or false. It modulates, wether d will output message or it wont.

`d.write = true; // output messages will be shown`
`d.write = false; //nothing will be shown`

## Usage in projects
The debug machine has three basic commands. `out, debug, warn and info` They all are functions of the form of `void out (std::string toWrite, bool nl = true);` They only change by how they output the messages: the output color.

To use, simply use

`d.out ("Hello"); //normal output, new line ----- <br /> `
`d.out ("Hello", false); //normal output, no new line ----- <br /> `
`d.warn ("Warning"); //normal warning [red], new line ----- `
`d.warn ("Warning", false); //normal warning, no new line ----- `
`d.info ("Info"); //normal info [cyan], new line ----- `
`d.into ("Info", false); //normal info, no new line ----- `
`d.debug ("Poor Mans Debugger"); //normal debug statement [magenta], new line ----- `
`d.debug ("Poor Mans Debugger", false); //normal debug statement, no new line ----- `

## Compatibility
Tested under GNU/Linux with Gcc-C++ of standard 11. No guarantee given for the reliability of my work [yet you are free to use it as you want to]
